From February to July 2021, I completed a 6 month internship in France in a Biotech company called ImaBiotech.

I started my internship as software developer on a .NET C# environment but was later moved on a new data science project.
The project consisted of using a software called QuPath to detect cells on an image, and use the information given by the software to identify the cells' phenotypes. Once the cells were identified, we studied their spatiality to get a deeper understanding of how cells' populations interacted with each others.

By the end of the internship, I wrote an application note, a white paper and a brochure for the workflow to be commercialized.
This workflow is now used for drug development research as this tool allows a deep analysis of a biological tissue to understand what is happening at the molecular level. Clients use it to closely follow the progression of a disease on a patient body or analyze what reaction follows the application of a certain chemical on a molecular tissue.
