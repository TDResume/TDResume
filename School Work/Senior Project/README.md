This folder is a small extract from my Senior Design project.
After segmenting cells by hand on a dozen of images, we are using a maskRCNN to create an instance segmentation algorithm.

We are creating an application, capable of handling complex images (multi-channel tiff files). Once the user load its image and selects a region of interest, she/he will be able to detect the cells in the tissue. The user will then be able to extract the cells information as a csv.

The current training script is not completed yet. More should be added as the project advances.
